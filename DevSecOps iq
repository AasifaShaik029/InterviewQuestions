1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security

Terraform script to deploy a secure EC2 instance:
Terraform
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Replace with your desired AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro" # Replace with your desired instance type
  key_name      = "my-key-pair" # Replace with your key pair name

  tags = {
    Name = "Secure EC2 Instance"
  }

  security_groups = ["sg-0123456789abcdef"] # Replace with your security group ID
}

resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name = "Secure EC2 Security Group"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] # Allow SSH from anywhere for demonstration, adjust as needed
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] # Allow all outbound traffic for demonstration, adjust as needed
  }
}
Use code with caution.

CloudFormation template to deploy a secure VM:
YAML
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: "Creates a secure EC2 instance with a security group"

Resources:
  EC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ImageId: "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Replace with your desired AMI
      InstanceType: "t2.micro" # Replace with your desired instance type
      KeyName: "my-key-pair" # Replace with your key pair name
      SecurityGroups:
        - Ref: EC2SecurityGroup
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: Secure EC2 Instance

  EC2SecurityGroup:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupName: Secure EC2 Security Group
      GroupDescription: "Allows SSH access"
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 22
          ToPort: 22
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0 # Allow SSH from anywhere for demonstration, adjust as needed
Use code with caution.

2. Security Scanning in CI/CD Pipeline

Jenkins pipeline with SonarQube integration:
Groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('SonarQube Analysis') {
            steps {
                sh 'sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=my-project -Dsonar.projectName=My Project -Dsonar.sources=src'
            }
        }
    }
}
Use code with caution.

Remediation steps:

Review SonarQube reports for vulnerabilities.
Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity.
Fix vulnerabilities in code and rebuild the application.
Re-run SonarQube analysis to verify the fixes.
3. Docker Container Security

Dockerfile with best practices:
Dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

# Install necessary packages
RUN apk add --no-cache bash curl

# Set a non-root user
RUN adduser appuser

# Copy application files
COPY . /app

# Change to non-root user
USER appuser

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application
CMD ["bash", "-c", "exec java -jar my-app.jar"]
Use code with caution.

Ensure secure container runtime:

Use a trusted container runtime like Docker or containerd.
Keep the runtime updated with the latest security patches.
Enforce security policies using tools like SELinux or AppArmor.
4. Automating Security with Ansible or Chef

Ansible playbook to apply security configurations:
YAML
- name: Disable SSH root login
  become: yes
  lineinfile:
    dest: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    regexp: "^PermitRootLogin yes"
    line: "PermitRootLogin no"
    state: present

- name: Install fail2ban
  become: yes
  apt:
    name: fail2ban
    state: present
Use code with caution.

Chef recipe to apply security configurations:
Ruby
execute 'disable_ssh_root_login' do
  command 'sed -i s/^PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/g /etc/ssh/sshd_config'
  only_if 'grep -q "^PermitRootLogin yes" /etc/ssh/sshd_config'
end

package 'fail2ban' do
  action :install
end
Use code with caution.

5. Secrets Management

Integrating HashiCorp Vault into a pipeline:
Groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Retrieve Secret') {
            steps {
                sh 'vault login -token my-vault-token'
                sh 'vault read secret/my-secret'
            }
        }
    }
}
Use code with caution.

Rotating and revoking secrets:

Use Vault's built-in rotation capabilities.
Revoke secrets when they are no longer needed.
Implement a policy to enforce secret rotation and revocation.
6. Vulnerability Management

Using OpenVAS for vulnerability scanning:
Bash
openvas-nvt-sync
openvas-scanner --target 192.168.1.100 --profile full
Use code with caution.

Automating vulnerability scans:

Schedule regular scans using cron jobs or automation tools.
Integrate vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline.
Analyze scan results and prioritize vulnerabilities.
7. Monitoring and Alerting for Security Threats

Configuring CloudWatch for security alerts:
YAML
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: "Creates a CloudWatch alarm for failed login attempts"

Resources:
  CloudWatchAlarm:
    Type: AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm
    Properties:
      AlarmName: "FailedLoginAttempts"
      MetricName: "FailedLoginAttempts"
      Namespace: "AWS/EC2"
      Statistic: "Sum"
      Period: 60
      EvaluationPeriods: 3
      Threshold: 5
      ComparisonOperator: "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold"
      AlarmActions:
        - Ref: SNSTopic
Use code with caution.

Integrating logging and monitoring tools:

Collect logs from various sources (e.g., servers, applications, containers).
Analyze logs for suspicious activity using tools like Elasticsearch and Kibana.
Set up alerts for anomalies or security threats.
8. Configure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Implementing RBAC in Kubernetes:
YAML
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: my-clusterrole
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["apps"]
    resources: ["deployments"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: Â  
 my-clusterrolebinding
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: my-user
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: my-clusterrole
Use code with caution.

Auditing access to critical resources:

Use audit logs to track user activity.
Analyze audit logs for unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.
Implement policies to enforce least-privilege access.
9. Network Security Implementation

Creating a security group rule:
Terraform
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "example" {
  type              = "ingress"
  protocol          = "tcp"
  from_port        = 80
  to_port          = 80
  cidr_blocks      = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.example.id
}
Use code with caution.

Monitoring network traffic:

Use tools like tcpdump or Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic.
Set up intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect suspicious activity.
10. Patch Management Automation

Ansible playbook for patching:
YAML
- name: Update package lists
  become: yes
Use code with caution.
